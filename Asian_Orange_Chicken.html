    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step1</h3>
    <h4><p>In a bowl, stir together warm water, brown sugar, orange juice, <br>
        soy sauce, ketchup, white vinegar, garlic, red pepper flakes, five-spice powder, <br>
        and orange peel until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is well combined.</p><br></h4>
    <h3>Step2</h3>
        <h4><p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat,<br> 
            and cook and stir the chicken until the outside is golden brown and the inside is no longer pink, 10 to 12 minutes.<br>
             Pour the sauce mixture over the chicken, bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cover the skillet. <br>
             Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p><br></h4>  
    <h3>Step3</h3>
            <h4><p>While the chicken and sauce are simmering, bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. <br>
                Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. 
                Set the rice aside and keep warm.</p><br></h4>

                Let the chicken and sauce cook for about 2 minutes to thicken, then serve over hot cooked rice, sprinkled with green onion.</p><br></h4>
